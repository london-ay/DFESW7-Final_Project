#  Nutrition API

Knowing what we eat matters. This is the reason why I chose to create this Nutrition API.

This is a Java Spring Boot API Project that lets the user interact with nutritional information about food items. The API allows the user to read, create, update, delete values. 
The API is built following agile software development methodologies in order to demonstrate the skills gained throughout the QA Software Development Bootcamp by delivering a minimum viable product to a set deadline.
Tools and concepts utilized include agile software development practices, continuous integration and continuous delivery, version control, object oriented programming, software testing, relational databases, Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Junit, Mockito, Postman, and others.

**Technologies used:**

Back-End Programming Language: **Java**
API Development Platform **: Spring**
Build Tool **: Maven**
Database Management System **: MySQL Server**
Version Control System: **Git**
Source Control Management: **GitHub**
Scrum Board: **Jira**
Unit & Integration Testing: **Junit & Mockito**

**How I expected the challenge to go?**

I expected the challenge to take long hours and a lot of research.

**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**

 I expected some high impact risks related to hardware, software, internet connectivity and the time limit. In practice I experienced no hardware issues, had some software bugs related to Postman with low impact on the project so they were acceptable. Testing took longer then 2 days so I decided to stick with the minimum test coverage of 60%.  

**Possible improvements for future revision of project:**

One of the main next steps for this project is developing a front-end. It was initially planned but due to the time restriction it was delayed until the next release.
